CHAPTER 1
THE PROBLEM AND ITS SETTING
INTRODUCTION
Biology, the natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, encompasses their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy. Despite its broad scope, biology is unified by core concepts such as the cell as the basic unit of life, heredity through genes, evolution, energy transformation, and homeostasis (LibreTexts, 2022). Fields including molecular biology, genetics, ecology, physiology, evolutionary biology, and anatomy collectively explore life’s complexity, origin, and diversity. Traditional pedagogies such as lectures and textbook-based instruction frequently fail to address diverse learning needs, especially in the Philippine senior high school context.

In recent years, educational technology has played an increasingly significant role in enhancing classroom instruction. Among these innovations, game-based learning has emerged as an effective approach to engaging students and promoting active learning, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. General Biology, a core subject under STEM, presents abstract and complex topics, such as cell division, genetics, and ecological systems that often challenge students' understanding. As a response, many educators and developers have begun integrating digital tools and interactive modules to support students’ mastery of key biological concepts.
Despite the rise of educational games and digital learning platforms, there remains a gap in context-specific and subject-focused game-based tools tailored for General Biology in the Philippine senior high school setting. According to Ang et al. (2025), game-based learning (GBL) is an instructional strategy that integrates games and technology to create interactive and engaging learning experiences. Their study demonstrated that GBL can significantly improve students’ understanding of science concepts, highlighting its potential as an effective tool for enhancing academic achievement in biology education. Traditional methods such as lectures and textbook-based instruction may fall short in capturing student interest or addressing individual learning needs. Moreover, local studies exploring the development and impact of interactive biology modules remain limited, highlighting the need for innovative resources that align with the K–12 curriculum and Filipino students' learning styles. 

Recent systematic reviews, such as that by Pramana et al. (2024), have shown a steady increase and effectiveness of digital game-based learning (DGBL) in biology education at all instructional levels. DGBL not only enhances content mastery but also fosters 21st-century skills like problem-solving and collaboration. Anastasiadis, Lampropoulos, and Siakas (2018) highlight that digital game-based learning platforms improve students’ vocabulary, memory, and understanding through immediate feedback and safe environments for practice. Chang et al. (2024) discusses how biological education has experienced a surge of interest in digital games, allowing students to experience biology in a more interactive way. The interactive approach to learning is encouraging for students in terms of learning complex concepts, improving student engagement in biology, and deepening student understanding of biological ideas. Educational games designed with technology, allow students to have engaging immersion. By focusing on the principles of game design, educators can create learning environments that apply gamification and accommodate student learning styles.

In the Philippine context, there remains a need for more culturally relevant and locally contextualized digital learning platforms. Lim and Rivera (2025) emphasize the importance of integrating local biological examples and contexts within game-based tools to boost relatability and cognitive engagement among Filipino students. Santos et al. (2024) further demonstrate that interactive simulations in biology education enhance critical thinking and problem-solving—competencies essential for scientific literacy.

This study aims to develop and evaluate GeneSys, an interactive game-based learning module designed to enhance students’ conceptual understanding and engagement in General Biology. By integrating educational games with curriculum-based content, GeneSys seeks to provide an alternative learning tool that fosters motivation, improves academic performance, and supports essential 21st-century skills. The results of this research may offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of game-based instruction and its potential as a complementary strategy for science education in the Philippine senior high school setting.

CHAPTER II
Review of Related Literature
	In this review of related literature, the researchers explore how game-based learning contributes to improving students’ understanding of general biology concepts. The review synthesizes studies on critical thinking skills, knowledge retention, learning efficacy, and mastery of concepts to provide a basis for the development and evaluation of the GeneSys module.

	Critical thinking is an important skill that helps students analyze, solve problems, and make wise decisions, and several studies have shown that it can be improved through digital and game-based learning. Gentile et al. (2019) found that students with strong critical thinking skills perform better and gain more knowledge when using serious games, while Supriyatno et al. (2020) explained that online learning platforms help learners become more reflective and analytical. Mao et al. (2021) and Chang and Yeh (2021) discovered that using both digital and traditional methods increases motivation, understanding, and engagement. Drevin et al. (2023) also found that interactive learning helps students make decisions and solve problems effectively. Agustiani et al. (2024), Mahmudah et al. (2024), and Chuang (2024) confirmed that game-based learning improves critical thinking in different subjects, while Rizki (2024) showed that digital and cooperative learning models consistently enhance higher-order thinking skills.
 
A study by Macayan, Baguistan, and Golias (2022) emphasized that students working in a game-based environment develop communication skills and teamwork by sharing ideas and performing tasks collectively. More recently, Situmorang et al. (2024) reinforced this idea by showing that digital game-based learning promotes social interaction and teamwork, which in turn enhances 21st-century competencies such as problem-solving and communication within the context of biology education. This suggests that GeneSys, by using a game-based format, is positioned not only to deliver biology content but also to cultivate essential skills necessary for academic and future success.

	Knowledge retention is one of the most consistent benefits highlighted in game-based learning research. Kantorski (2022) reported that scaffolded and iterative interventions through digital games significantly improved students’ ability to retain knowledge. Tavares (2022) echoed this in a systematic review of nursing education, showing that game-based approaches not only supported knowledge retention but also boosted motivation, engagement, and critical thinking. Extending this evidence, Kanade, Hasanzadeh, Pitts, Esmaeili, and Duffy (2024) found that game-based ap  proaches sustain long-term knowledge retention. Their findings attribute this effect to the interactive and engaging features of games, which promote deeper cognitive processing and memory consolidation compared to traditional learning methods. These factors— engagement and motivation— are fundamental to maximizing the learning experience and indirectly contribute to better retention, reinforcing the value of the GeneSys design.

	The mastery of concepts in biology has also been shown to improve through game-based strategies. Punyasettro and Yasri (2021) developed the VERT card game to teach chordate phylogeny, and their study demonstrated enhanced mastery of evolutionary biology concepts along with increased student motivation and confidence. Situmorang et al. (2024) also highlighted that digital games enable students to actively engage with difficult biological content, thus improving their problem-solving abilities and conceptual understanding. Similarly, Caparoso and Orleans (2024) found that inquiry-based digital games provide experiential and active learning opportunities, making them more effective than traditional methods for mastering complex biology concepts. The use of an interactive, game-based module like GeneSys provides a superior method for students to actively engage with, understand, and ultimately master complex general biology concepts, supported by increased motivation and enhanced problem-solving skills.

	Self-efficacy refers to students’ belief in their ability to learn and perform tasks successfully, and several studies have shown that it can be improved through digital and game-based learning approaches. Lu and Lien (2019) found that students who saw game-based learning as both enjoyable and educational developed stronger self-efficacy compared to those who viewed it as only a game. Meccawy et al. (2023) also reported that game-based assessments increased students’ confidence and motivation because of engaging elements such as feedback and rewards. Ciloglu et al. (2023) discovered that students who used mobile augmented reality for biology learning had higher self-efficacy than those taught through traditional methods. Likewise, Zolkipli and Suradi (2023) concluded that game-based courseware motivates learners, promotes self-learning, and improves overall performance. Lin, Wang, and Hsieh (2024) found that digital games enhance students’ confidence and self-regulated learning strategies, while Chu et al. (2024) emphasized the importance of goal setting and structured activities in strengthening self-efficacy. Zhang (2024) and Getenet et al. (2024) also highlighted that technology-based learning improves students’ attitudes and engagement.

	 In addition, Hu (2024) observed that game-based strategies make lessons more dynamic compared to traditional lectures, enhancing motivation. Lantzouni et al. (2024) emphasized that tailored games simplify complex biology topics, which not only increases engagement but also calls for clearer goals and adaptive challenges for optimal learning. Complementing these findings, ProdigeGame (2024) demonstrated that challenges and rewards within digital games significantly enhance both cognitive and emotional engagement in biology. 

	Research also demonstrates measurable improvement in student performance after exposure to game-based learning. Jurada (2024) showed that learners significantly improved their biology scores in post-tests compared to pre-tests after being exposed to game-based and project-based approaches. This evidence confirms the potential of game-based strategies to bring about tangible learning gains. The reviewed literature provides a theoretical foundation for the development and evaluation of GeneSys. The evidence consistently supports the idea that game-based strategies lead to significant and measurable improvements in learning across multiple critical areas.

	Despite its benefits, game-based learning faces several challenges. Hu (2024) pointed out the absence of structured feedback and debriefing sessions as one major limitation, since these are vital for consolidating learning and guiding student reflection. The study also identified practical barriers such as large class sizes with limited facilitators, which reduced the effectiveness of game-based approaches. Furthermore, the reliance on non-digital games limited opportunities for integrating technology into the learning process. These challenges highlight the need for well-structured interventions that include reflection, adequate facilitation, and digital tools to expand learning opportunities. The study consistently supports the strategy's potential to drive significant and measurable improvements across multiple critical areas, while also cautioning against common implementation pitfalls.

SYNTHESIS OF THE REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
The reviewed studies collectively affirm that game-based learning significantly enhances students’ understanding of general biology concepts by improving critical thinking, knowledge retention, mastery of concepts, and self-efficacy. Researchers consistently report that interactive and digital games foster engagement, motivation, and deeper cognitive processing, which lead to better academic outcomes compared to traditional methods. Studies also highlight that game-based approaches promote collaboration, confidence, and self-directed learning, aligning with the goals of the GeneSys module. However, challenges such as limited feedback and inadequate facilitation underscore the need for structured reflection and effective implementation. Overall, the literature supports that well-designed game-based learning tools like GeneSys can create meaningful and enjoyable learning experiences that lead to measurable improvements in student performance.















CHAPTER 3 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
This chapter comprises the design section of the study and includes the research locale, sample and sampling technique, instrumentation, data gathering procedure, and statistical treatment of data.

RESEARCH DESIGN
	This study utilizes a quantitative, quasi-experimental research design. This design is deemed appropriate as the study aims to determine the effectiveness of the GeneSys game-based learning module in enhancing the academic performance of Grade 12 STEM students. According to Ghanad (2023), quantitative research involves the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of numerical data to test hypotheses and draw objective conclusions. Similarly, Sreekumar (2024) explained that quasi-experimental research is conducted when random assignment of participants is not feasible due to ethical or practical considerations, yet it still seeks to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. 

In this study, two groups of respondents will be involved. The first group, referred to as the experimental group, will utilize the GeneSys digital game-based learning module, while the second group, referred to as the control group, will receive instruction through traditional teaching methods. Both groups will undergo a pretest and post-test to measure their performance in terms of critical thinking skills, knowledge retention, learning efficacy, and mastery of concepts. The comparison between the pretest and post-test results will serve as the basis for determining whether the use of the GeneSys digital module has a significant effect on students’ understanding in General Biology. 

The quasi-experimental design is considered suitable for this research as it allows the evaluation of the developed instructional material in a natural classroom setting while maintaining scientific rigor. It enables the researchers to determine the effectiveness of the intervention through statistical analysis using appropriate tools such as the mean, standard deviation, and t-test. The findings derived from this design will provide empirical evidence on the impact of game-based learning on students’ academic performance, thereby contributing to the improvement of instructional strategies in Biology education. 

RESEARCH LOCALE
The study will be conducted at Puerto Galera National High School, a public secondary institution located in Puerto Galera. The school is known for offering various academic strands under the K–12 Senior High School Curriculum, including the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) strand. As one of the leading secondary schools in the municipality, it provides quality education that equips students with knowledge and skills essential for higher learning and future careers in science-related fields. The institution’s commitment to academic excellence and innovation makes it an ideal setting for implementing and evaluating educational interventions such as the GeneSys game-based learning module.
	The research will particularly focus on the Grade 12 STEM students from the sections Galileo Galilei and Thomas Edison. These sections will be chosen because their curriculum includes General Biology, which is directly related to the objectives of the study. Conducting the research within this locale allowed the researchers to observe how the GeneSys module could enhance students’ understanding of biological concepts in an authentic classroom environment. The accessibility of the participants and the school’s openness to research-based innovations will further support the successful implementation of the study.

SAMPLE AND SAMPLING TECHNIQUE
The study employed a purposive-quota sampling technique to select participants who met the specific criteria aligned with the research objectives. Purposive sampling was used to ensure that only qualified respondents—Grade 12 STEM students enrolled in General Biology at Puerto Galera National High School—were included, as they represent the intended users of the GeneSys game-based learning module.
Quota sampling was then applied to maintain equal representation between the two sections involved in the study: STEM 12 – Galileo Galilei and STEM 12 – Thomas Edison. A total of sixty (60) respondents were selected, with thirty (30) students from each section. The selection of participants was based on the academic records provided by the General Biology teacher, focusing on students’ performance during the second semester. This sampling approach ensured that both groups were appropriately represented within the quasi-experimental design, allowing for a fair comparison of students’ performance before and after the implementation of the GeneSys module.

RESEARCH INSTRUMENT
	In this study, the researchers utilized a standardized test questionnaire to determine the level of students’ performance before and after the implementation of GeneSys. The instrument was designed to measure four key parameters aligned with the study’s objective: critical thinking skills, knowledge retention, learning efficiency, and mastery of concepts. 
Moreover, the standardized test was administered to the selected Grade 12 STEM students from the sections Galileo Galilei and Thomas Edison to assess their understanding and engagement in General Biology. The same standardized test was used for both the pretest and post-test phases to measure any significant improvement in students’ performance after exposure to the GeneSys. The results gathered from the instrument served as the basis for evaluating the module’s effectiveness as a game-based learning tool.

DATA GATHERING PROCEDURE
Before conducting the study, the researchers sought approval from the principal and advisers of STEM 12–Galileo Galilei and STEM 12–Thomas Edison at Puerto Galera National High School. Parental consent and student assent forms were distributed to ensure voluntary participation. After approval, both the experimental and control groups were given a pretest  to determine their initial level of performance in terms of critical thinking skills, knowledge retention, learning efficacy, and mastery of concepts Following the pretest, the GeneSys game-based learning module will be implemented.The experimental group will be exposed to the GeneSys digital game-based learning module, while the control group will receive the same Biology lessons through traditional instruction. The module will serve as an interactive learning tool designed to help students better understand topics in the second semester of General Biology that were identified as difficult based on the subject teacher’s records. The implementation will be conducted in multiple sessions, each lasting 40–60 minutes, ensuring that all participants will receive equal time and guidance in using the module.
After completing all sessions, both groups will take a post-test using the same instrument to measure immediate learning gains. All responses will be collected, coded, and analyze using appropriate statistical tools, including percentage, mean, standard deviation, t-test, and ANCOVA. Attendance logs and observation checklists will also be utilize to ensure consistency, fairness, and equal instructional time for both groups throughout the study.	

STATISTICAL TOOL AND TREATMENTS
The results of the organized tabulated data will be treated statistically. The following statistical treatments will be used to interpret the data gathered from the pretest and post-test administration.
Descriptive Statistics will be used to summarize and characterized the data set, specifically addressing SOP 1 (Pretest performance) and SOP 2 (Post-test performance). This determines the students’ initial and final performance across the four parameters: Critical thinking skills, Knowledge Retention, Learning efficiency, and Mastery of concepts. 

1. Percentage (%). This is used to compute the frequency and percent distribution of the respondents. In this study, this will be utilized to calculate the percentage of the respondents based on their age and sex.
The formula is:  % = (F)/N x 100%
Where: 
% - Percentage
F – Frequency
N – Total no. of Respondents

2. Arithmetic Mean (x̄). the mean will be computed to determine the average level of students’ performance for both pretest and post-test phases. The mean will be used to establish the baseline and final status for each group.
The formula is:  x̄ = (∑x)/n
Where: 
x̄= the mean value
(∑x) = the sum of all individual scores
n = the total number of respondents

3. Standard deviation (SD). This will be computed to measure the dispersion or variability of the scores around the mean, which indicates the consistency of the score within the groups for both the pretest and post-test.
The formula is s = √ (∑ (x - x̄)2 / (N - 1))

Inferential statistics will be utilized to test the primary research hypothesis and directly address SOP 3: ”Is there a significant difference between the students’ performance before and after the implementation of the GeneSys digital game-based learning module?”

4. Paired Sample t-test. This test will be used to compare the mean score of the pretest and post-test within the Experimental group (GeneSys) and within the Control Group ( Traditional Method), respectively. This will determine if there is a statistically significant change in performance for each group following the intervention period.

5. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). To provide most rigorous test of the intervention’s impact, ANCOVA will be used to compare the Post-test mean scores between Experimental Group and the Control Group. The ANCOVA will statistically control for preexisting differences by using the pretest score as a covariate. This isolates the effect attributable solely to the GeneSys module and provides a more accurate assessment of its efficacy compared to the traditional method.
